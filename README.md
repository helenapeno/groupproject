# groupproject
Our group project will feature an interactive recipebook where users can add, view, and edit recipes. The user can save recipes created by other users and once a recipe is saved they have the opportunity to edit it. We hope to use an api to create additional recipes 
The homepage will display the users saved recipes one one chart and recipes created by other users on another.
